[1:A]                 SAMPLE_NAME                        The sample name can be derived from a number of sources. In many cases it originates from the cell line name. Other sources include names assigned by the annotators, or an incremented number assigned during an anonymization process..
[2:B]                 COSMIC_SAMPLE_ID                   A unique COSMIC sample identifier (COSS) is used to identify a sample. This identifier can be used to retrieve additional Sample information from the Cosmic_Sample file.
[3:C]                 COSMIC_PHENOTYPE_ID                A unique COSMIC identifier (COSO) for the classification. This identifier can be used to retrieve tissue and histology information from the classification file.
[4:D]                 COSMIC_STRUCTURAL_ID               A COSMIC structural identifier (COST). This identifier can be used to retrieve structural variants from the Cosmic_StructuralVariants file
[5:E]                 MUTATION_TYPE                      Types of mutation: Intra/Inter (chromosomal), tandem duplication, deletion, inversion, complex substitutions, complex amplicons.
[6:F]                 DESCRIPTION                        A syntax which describes the structural variant, based on HGVS recommendations.
[7:G]                 PUBMED_PMID                        The PUBMED ID for the paper that the sample was noted in.
[8:H]                 COSMIC_STUDY_ID                    A unique COSMIC study identifier (COSU) is used to identify a study that have involved this structural variant.
[9:I]                 ID_STRUC_GEN                       An ID representing structural genomic.
[10:J]                CHROMOSOME_FROM                    The chromosome where the first structural variant occurs.
[11:K]                CHROMOSOME_TO                      The chromosome where the last structural variant occurs.
[12:L]                LOCATION_FROM_MIN                  The first position in structural variant range.
[13:M]                LOCATION_FROM_MAX                  The last position in structural variant range.
[14:N]                LOCATION_TO_MIN                    The first position in structural variant range.
[15:O]                LOCATION_TO_MAX                    The last position in structural variant range.
[16:P]                STRAND_FROM                        Positive or negative (+1/-1) where the first structural variant occurs.
[17:Q]                STRAND_TO                          Positive or negative (+1/-1) where the last structural variant occurs.
