  File Description

[column number:label] Heading                                           Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1:A]                GENE_SYMBOL                  The gene name for which the data has been curated in COSMIC. In most cases this is the accepted HGNC identifier.
[2:B]                COSMIC_GENE_ID               A unique COSMIC gene identifier (COSG) is used to identify a gene within the file. This identifier can be used to retrieve additional Gene information from the Cosmic_Genes file. Additional Tier 1 Cancer Gene Census information can be accessed with this identifier from the Cosmic_CancerGeneCensus file.
[3:C]                CELL_TYPE                    Tissue or cancer for which the Hallmark is described.
[4:D]                PUBMED_PMID                  The PUBMED ID for the paper that the Hallmark was noted in.
[5:E]                HALLMARK                     Name of the biological process that when dysregulated, may promote cancer or other data category describing the role of a gene in cancer.
[6:F]                IMPACT                       Describes how the gene activity impacts the hallmarks of cancer i.e. promotes/suppresses or characterises the role of a gene in carcinogenesis i.e. Oncogene/Tumour suppressor Gene/Fusion.
[7:G]                DESCRIPTION                  A brief functional summary of how gene's activity impacts a hallmark of cancer.
[8:H]                CELL_LINE                    For evidence obtained from experiments on cell lines, the name of the cell lines are provided here.
