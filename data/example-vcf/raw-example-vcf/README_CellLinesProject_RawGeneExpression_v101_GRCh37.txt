Cell Lines Project Raw Gene Expression
--------------------------------------
  The platform used was the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array. This file contains all the raw gene expression data from the most current release of COSMIC Cell Lines Project in a tab separated file. [ CellLinesProject_RawGeneExpression_v101_GRCh37.tsv.gz ]

[1:A]                 COSMIC_SAMPLE_ID                   A unique COSMIC sample identifier (COSS) is used to identify a sample. This identifier can be used to retrieve additional Sample information from the CellLinesProject_Sample file.
[2:B]                 SAMPLE_NAME                        The sample name can be derived from a number of sources. In many cases it originates from the cell line name. Other sources include names assigned by the annotators, or an incremented number assigned during an anonymization process..
[3:C]                 COSMIC_GENE_ID                     A unique COSMIC gene identifier (COSG) is used to identify a gene within the file. This identifier can be used to retrieve additional Gene information from the Cosmic_Genes file.
[4:D]                 GENE_SYMBOL                        The gene name for which the data has been curated in COSMIC. In most cases this is the accepted HGNC identifier.
[5:E]                 GENE_EXPRESSION                    Expression level for the gene from the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array data.
