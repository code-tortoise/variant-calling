[1:A]                 COSMIC_GENE_ID               A unique COSMIC gene identifier (COSG) is used to identify a gene within the file. Other download files can be linked to this file using this identifier.
[2:B]                 LEGACY_GENE_ID               A unique COSMIC legacy gene identifier (COSG) used to find the gene and the Ensembl canonical transcript on the COSMIC website.
[3:C]                 GENE_SYMBOL                  The gene name for which the data has been curated in COSMIC. In most cases this is the accepted HGNC identifier.
[4:D]                 GENE_ACCESSION               Unique Ensembl gene identifier (ENSG). For details see: https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/stable_ids/index.html
[5:E]                 ENTREZ_ID                    Entrez ID mapping.
[6:F]                 HGNC_ID                      HGNC mapping.
[7:G]                 IN_CANCER_CENSUS             Is this gene part of the cancer census (y/n).
[8:H]                 IS_EXPERT_CURATED            Has the gene been manually curated by the team of expert curators (y/n).
